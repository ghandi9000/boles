Predicting tree heights, bole volumes, and plot-level canopy heighs for various species in Moosilauke forest.  Heights were predicted with basic power function.  Bole volumes were predicted using Honer, Kozak and Clark equations.

Issues
------

There are still a few trees with dbhs that are missing bole volumes.

Dependencies
------------

### Scripts

* [functions-boles.R](http://github.com/ghandi9000/functions)

### Repositories

* [data](http://github.com/ghandi9000/data)

Data
----

Final bole calculations are in:
* [boles.csv](https://github.com/ghandi9000/data/tree/master/data/boles)

Directory Layout
----------------

* Scripts used for final analysis are in final directory
* The rest are raw scripts
